== Description ==

Get rid of YouTube logo while playing, and also only show related videos from same channel. Great when you're embedding your own videos and don't want to show your competitors videos when the user pauses and after the video is done.

The settings will affect all YouTube blocks.

== Installation ==
 
Search for `Settings for YouTube block` under Plugins on your WordPress install or download and:

1. Upload `settings-for-youtube-block` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You're done

== Screenshots ==
 
1. With the plugin: No YouTube logo and related videos will come from the same channel as the video that was just played. If it's your own channel, only your own videos will show here.

2. Without the plugin: YouTube logo and related videos from any other channel. Maybe your competitors?
